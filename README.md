  Shader works like 9-slice sprites, but for 3d meshes. 
  The shader automatically handles the scales of the objects,
  and stretchs the center of the mesh to make edges of the mesh even size.

#### original source:
  i did not make this, this was forked from https://github.com/Shahzod114/unity-27-slice-shader
  which is down. The dev reuploaded it to https://github.com/specoolar/Unity-Shaders
